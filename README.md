# DogBreedSpotter
DogBreedSpotter is a Python-based image classification project designed to identify and classify dog breeds in images. This project utilizes deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet, to accurately detect whether an image contains a dog and, if so, determine the breed.
