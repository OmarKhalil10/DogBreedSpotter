# DogBreedSpotter

## Description

**DogBreedSpotter** is a Python-based image classification project designed to identify and classify dog breeds in images. This project utilizes deep learning models, including convolutional neural networks (CNNs) such as VGG, AlexNet, and ResNet, to accurately detect whether an image contains a dog and, if so, determine the breed.

## Key Features

- Image classification to identify dogs
- Accurate breed classification for dog images
- Utilizes pre-trained deep learning models
- Measures algorithm accuracy and runtime performance
- Supports various dog breeds recognition

## Objective

The primary goal of **DogBreedSpotter** is to provide a reliable tool for dog breed identification, making it useful for various applications, including dog shows, pet registration, and more.

## Usage
